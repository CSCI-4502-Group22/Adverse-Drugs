Description:

Analyzing data from the FDA Adverse Event reporting sytem to find information about severe drugs and the profits of those drugs with their manufacturers.

Questions to answer:

What drugs are the most severe?
- What kinds of drugs have the highest rates of mortality or hospitalization.

What drugs are most Frequently reported?
- are drugs that are more severe frequently reported and what kind of drugs are they.

Is there a correlation between Severity and Net profit?
- When severity scores are high and increase over time, is there a positive correlation between sale increase?
Is there a correlation between Number of Cases and profit?
- As the number of cases increase, do profits increase at the same rate.

Application:


This information is readily available to the public. The FDA is a well respected source of information about ingestible products in the United States, however this source of information takes time to parse through. The FDA has made strides in creating a portal into which the public can access information about Adverse Events related to specific drugs, however it is not advertised as such. Here is some applications I beleive to be useful to the public if it were promoted to do research before being prescribed a drug.

  This information is directly related to pharmaceutical companies and their products. Since this is public information, there is nothing stopping anybody from finding this data, which could be decision between whether or not a patient wishes to take the medication. This could potentially affect sales, especially if a drug is related to high severity score as calculated. It could be in a companies best interest to use this information and promote a constant decrease in severity over time into their annual sales reports. While the have section about deaths, this information, if formatted right, could promote a competitive nature towards companies to reduce their severity scores overtime.
  
  They can even see how their product interacts with people with pre-existing conditions overtime, as well as dosage information and drug therapy types. This is valuable knowledge for the development of pharmaceutical companies and their products. It can promote relationships with the patients prescribed to their medication and create a destigmatization of their companies.

{Public Knowledge}
  
  With the revelation that certain over the counter drugs have a large frequency of reported cases, it useful knowledge to the public to understand what could potentially happen when taking certain drugs.
For instance, in terms of pre-natal care, since Folic acid has a large amount of cases reported each year, it may be valuable information to OBGYN clinics to better understand certain information about recommended supplements used during pregnancy. While Folic Acid does pose a serious health risk, it is worth noting that some complications can occur using this, and therefore would inspire further research into that particular area.
 
 For a more umbrella case, the number of reported cases for certain painkillers, specifically Acetaminophen have a high number of reported cases per year. Often the combination of Alcohol and Tylenol can cause liver damage, which happens often when people treat extreme hangovers after inebriation. This is may be common knowledge, but for certain demographics they could not know. It is important to have this research easily available to public to better understand these medications in general.
Mental Health Field}
This information could be especially helpful to people working in the mental health field as way to research products before prescribing them to patients.
  
  Of mental health medications Abilify had the highest severity score and was the most frequently reported medication to have Adverse Events over the past 3 years. This is a medication used to treat schizophrenia and anxiety in extreme cases. The information in the FDA portal is easily accessible and shows how much increase and decrease in deaths and cases overtime are related to that specific drug. This is useful information for psychiatrists who may want to consider a better option to treat schizophrenia and opens up better communication with their patients about the risks involved with taking a medication.
